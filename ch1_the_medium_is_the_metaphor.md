The Medium is the Metaphor
==========================


# Constructs

* Conversations are all techniques and technologies that permit people of a
particular culture to exchange messages.

* A metaphor suggests what a thing is like by comparing it to something else.

<!--


Light is a wave; Light is a particle

The term "light" is used to refer to a set of something, it has certain
properties but the properties here doesn't define what light is, because if we
later find that the certain property doesn't hold in all cases we will continue
to that something as light. When something is defined by some property then by
definition the property will always hold.

Metaphors are linguistic homomorphisms (oops a recursive definitions) defined
over certain properties. When I say light is particle then is means that light
and particles have certain property which is same. The metaphor is stronger when
there is homomorphism between a lot of properties and even stronger when the
homomorphism is an isomorphism.

A set can be homomorphic to two different sets which aren't homomorphic to each
other, so statements like Light is both wave and a particle isn't a
contradiction. This "is" isn't same as equals, it is nor reflexive neither
transitive.

Medium is a metaphor to metaphors. Metaphors are maps from things to things.
Medium/media maps the outside world to the constructs in our mind.

# Perspectives

<!-- `Meta`, choosing what variables to look at for a complex multi variable
function. Complex in the general sense not as in complex numbers -->

See new media not just as extension of previous media but also as a means to
bring radical philosophical and physiological transformations.

Examples of this perspective:

* Through clock we learned irreverence toward the sun.
* Eye-glass refuted the belief that anatomy is destiny.


# Arguments

<!-- It is a  concrete prediction, can also be taken as a perspective it is not very
concrete -->

* Ideas which are convenient to express inevitably becomes the important content
of a culture.




# Evidences and data and trivia

<!--
trivia may or may not act as an evidence for some argument
-->

<!-- A established argument is a valid evidence -->

<!--  It depends on the context and tone if some statement is an argument or used
as an evidence -->

* Writing freezes speech and in so doing gives birth to the grammarian, the
  logician, the rhetorician, the historian, the scientist -- all those who must
hold language before them so that they can see what it means, where it errs, and
where it is leading.

* Variations in structure of languages results in variations of the world view.

* Smoke signal's cannot be used to do philosophy.

* Each medium makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new
  orientation for thought, for expression, for sensibility.

* Some Abrahamic religions disallow depiction of the prophet in images.


## Other arguments

* "News of the Day" is only possible because of telegraph.

### Sub argument:

* The world before that lacked a media to advertise fires, wars, murders and
  love affairs.

* You cannot do political philosophy on television.

### Sub argument

* The form of television works against the content of Political Philosophy.

# Unclassified

* Media make a no statement.

* Media-metaphors classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge
  it, reduce it, color it, argue a case for what the world is like.

* Media acts as filter to information.
