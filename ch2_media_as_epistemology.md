Media as Epistemology
====================

Argument
--------

Much of the content of our public discourse has become dangerously non sense, as
a result of the shift in media.

* Argument not based on aesthetic or literary criticism.


## Constructs

Episemology: study of origins and nature of knowledge. (sentiment: complex and
usually opaque)

## Argument

The definition of truth is derived, at least partly, from the character of the
media used for communication. It is linked to the biases of forms of expression.

### Evidences

* In a tribe in western africa that has no writing system, the chief of the
  tribe takes decisions in a disputed situation by searching through the vaset
repertoire of proverbs and sayings to find one that suits the situation.
Also a method of Jesus and Biblical figures. The though consists of proverbs and
sayings. That idea is non existant in todays court rooms.


* A student cited a quotation as "Told to ... on ... in presence of ..." and he
  was asked to remove it. The student argued that other literature citations
will hardly be reviewed then why do they assume accuracy of a print citation but
not speech-referenced one. He was then told that print citations are easier to
verify or refute and written word is assumed to have been reflected upon and
revised by the author.

* For the ancient greek the rhetoric was not merely an opportunity for dramatic
  performance but a near indispensable means of organizing evidence and proofs.
Through rhetoric "right" opinion was both discovered and articulated.

* Scientific truth is discovered and expressed by deducing the nature of things
  from a set of self-evident premises.
<!-- This is what I'm doing here -->

### perspectives

* A modern economist articulating truths about our standard of living by
  reciting a poem? Or by telling what happened to him during a late-night walk
through East St. Louis? Or by offering a series of proverbs and parables,
beginning with the saying about a rich man, a camel, and the eye of a needle?
The first would be regarded as irrelevant, the second merely anecdotal, the last
childish. But to modern mind the truth in economics is belived to be best
discovered and expressed in numbers.


### Constructs

Resonance: Through resonace a particular statement in a particular context
acquires a universal significance.

## Argument

Some ways of telling the truth is better than others.


### Argument

Intelligence is derived from the character of its important forms of
communication.


#### Evidences

* In a purely oral culture, intelligence is often associated with aphoristic
  ingenuity, that is, the power to invent compact sayings of wide applicability.
Eg, The wise Solomon.

* In oral cultures a high value if placed on the the power to memorize. In print
  age is merely charming.
<!-- Our primary and secondary eduction is still in the oral times. /me sighs -->


* Characteristics of print-intelligence:
    * Detachment and objectivity


Quotes
-----

* We do not measure a culture by its output of undisguised trivialities but by
what it claims as significant. p16

* Truth is a product of a conversation man has with himself about and through
  the techniques of communica- tion he has invented.
